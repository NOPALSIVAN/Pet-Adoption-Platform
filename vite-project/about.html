Straightforward Pet Rehoming And Adoption
PetAdopatation is a new digital platform with real people behind the scenes. Our platform connects potential adopters with people who need to rehome their pets. This makes it easier for good people to adopt the right pet whilst maximising the chance of pets finding their forever home.

We offer a non-judgmental service to rehomers and give them full control of the process.

We're also helping to reduce the number of animals going into shelters. This frees up space and resources for the pets who have been abandoned, need immediate help or specialist care.
